									<h3>HST Filing</h3>
									<p>GST/HST filing is a mandatory requirement for registered Canadian businesses. The Canadian government guidelines stipulate that businesses with an annual income exceeding $30,000 must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). Failure to collect or remit sales tax or file GST/HST returns by the deadline can result in substantial penalties imposed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
										At Accounting And Financials, we specialize in assisting businesses with GST/HST compliance. Our services include registering your business for GST/HST, providing guidance on the applicable sales tax rates, and advising you on the payment due dates.

Navigating the complex landscape of payroll taxes and regulations can be challenging for entrepreneurs. That's why we offer flexible and customizable payroll solutions to help you design efficient systems that comply with tax laws.

										By outsourcing your payroll processing to us, you can rest assured that your employees will be paid promptly and that you will stay in compliance with local and federal payroll regulations.
